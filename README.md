# Ableton Homepage Recreation

This is a front-end practice project where I recreate the homepage of [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) as closely as possible.

## Challenge
- Challenge from [Frontend Practice](https://www.frontendpractice.com/project/ableton)
- Goal: Rebuild the layout, design, and responsiveness of the Ableton homepage.
- Time limit: 2h

## Tech Stack
- React
- Vite
- TailwindCSS

## Project Setup
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Notes
- This project focuses purely on the front-end.
- No external APIs or backend integration.
- Mobile responsiveness and accessibility are prioritized.

## Final personal impression
Typing manually all the content took a little while. 2h is too short to fully make it responsive. (don't try phone format ðŸ«£)
Yes there are typos, yes it's not pixel perfect. But I was practicing my ability to code under pressure.

## Instructor's Comment
This project demonstrates solid real-world front-end instincts:
- Smart structural planning (components, layout first)
- Fast adaptation using TailwindCSS (grids, flex, utility classes)
- Strong time management and task prioritization under a strict 2h challenge
- Awareness of abstraction (global styles for repetitive patterns)
- Clear separation of concerns between structure and styling

While the project was not fully responsive in the initial 2h window, the foundational work was clean, scalable, and positioned for easy continuation.

Great professional habits were reinforced: finishing cleanly, recognizing when to stop, and respecting personal energy management.
